About: This project is a mod for the game Slay The Spire that adds a new character to the game with 35 new cards. Running the mod requires a copy of the game, but you can still explore
the cards by nagivating to src/main/java/swashbuckler/cards, then choosing a card rarity such as common to view the code for the cards.
